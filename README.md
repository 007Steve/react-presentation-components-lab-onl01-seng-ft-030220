# React Presentation Components Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice defining stateless functions as React components
2. Practice using stateless functions as React components

## Overview

This lab should be pretty easy. We want to test that students know how to write
their own stateless functions as components (we should be able to test that they
spit out markup without backing instances) and that they can use them (we can
write a few components and ask students to include them in small widget-y
things).
